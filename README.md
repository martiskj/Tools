# Various Software Tools

In the lack of integrated functions in Windows (or options found at the huge internet), this is a collection of various tools I've made and found useful. All the tools are made to be run from the terminal in Unix (or Cygwin for Windows). All tools comes with a help option which is accessed by typing `<tool> -h`. Following is the description for each tool, which is the same message that will appear if you use the help option:

####Pdfmerge
```
pdfmerge.py [FILE 1] [FILE 2] ... [FILE N] [OUTPUTNAME]
        Merges 'FILE 1' through 'FILE N' into 'OUTPUTNAME.pdf'
        Note that 'OUTPUTNAME' should not include '.pdf' extension
```

####Pdfmake
```
pdfmake [FILE]
        Creates a pdf of the given inputfile if it exists.
        Known functional extensions:
                .py
```
